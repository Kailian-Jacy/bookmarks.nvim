## BookmarksMarkToList

Collection snippets anytime anywhere by one command.

For example: while I'm creating lua plugin, I found some interesting implementation.

Even though my current active bookmark list is not the one I want to put this piece in.

I can still trigger the command and select one specific list to put this mark in.
