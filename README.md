# Bookmarks.nvim

You only need one shortcut to add bookmarks.

- Toggle mark: Add and Remove mark with one shortcut
- Mark with name: so you can record more information
- Icon and virtual text: display icon and name at the marked lines
- Group your bookmarks: so keep you away from the noises
- Persistent your bookmarks into a human reable json file, which you can manipulate munally

## Install and Config

- Simple version: everything should work out of box if you are ok with the default config.

```lua
-- with lazy.nvim
return {
  "LintaoAmons/bookmarks.nvim",
  tag = "v0.5.3", -- optional, pin the plugin at specific version for stability
  dependencies = {
    {"nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim"},
    {"stevearc/dressing.nvim"} -- optional: to have the same UI shown in the GIF
  }
}
```

```lua
return { "LintaoAmons/bookmarks.nvim",
  config = function ()
    require("bookmarks").setup( {
      json_db_path = vim.fs.normalize(vim.fn.stdpath("config") .. "/bookmarks.db.json"),
      signs = {
        mark = { icon = "ï‚—", color = "grey" },
      },
    })
  end
}

## Commands and Keybindings

There's two concepts in this plugin: `BookmarkList` and `Bookmark`. You can look into the code to find the structure of those two domain objects

| Command               | Description                                   |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `BookmarksMark`       | Mark current line into active BookmarkList.   |
| `BookmarksGoto`       | Go to bookmark at current active BookmarkList |
| `BookmarksCommands`   | Find and trigger a bookmark command.          |
| `BookmarksGotoRecent` | Go to latest visited/created Bookmark         |

This plugin don't provide any default keybinding. I recommend you to have those three keybindings.

```lua
vim.keymap.set({ "n", "v" }, "mm", "<cmd>BookmarksMark<cr>", { desc = "Mark current line into active BookmarkList." })
vim.keymap.set({ "n", "v" }, "mo", "<cmd>BookmarksGoto<cr>", { desc = "Go to bookmark at current active BookmarkList" })
vim.keymap.set({ "n", "v" }, "ma", "<cmd>BookmarksCommands<cr>", { desc = "Find and trigger a bookmark command." })
vim.keymap.set({ "n", "v" }, "mg", "<cmd>BookmarksGotoRecent<cr>", { desc = "Go to latest visited/created Bookmark" })
```

## TODO

### V1

- [x] BookmarksMark's input box as a command line. Text start with `!` considered as command.
  - [x] `!newlist [listname]` bookmark current line into a newly created bookmark list and set the list as current active list.
- [x] remove parse commands, prefer BookmarkCommands instead
- [x] `BookmarkCommands` commands picker, a picker allow user to trigger any bookmark command.
- [ ] user defined commands
- [x] more useful information when deal with corrupted json db (no issues report yet)
- [ ] refactor: extract picker module
- [ ] Telescope as default picker and will fallback to vim.ui if don't have telescope dependencies
- [x] telescope enhancement (use specific command instead)
- [ ] Recent files as bookmarks: record all the buffer the user recently opened and sort by the visited_at
- [x] A new command to create bookmark and put it into specific bookmark list (instead current active one)
- [ ] goto next/prev bookmark in the current buffer

### V2

- [ ] filetree-like BookmarkList and Bookmark browsing.
- [ ] smart location calibration according to bookmark content
