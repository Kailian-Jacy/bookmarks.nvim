## Install and Config

- Simple version: everything should work out of box if you are ok with the default config.

```lua
-- with lazy.nvim
return {
  "LintaoAmons/bookmarks.nvim",
  tag = "v0.5.3", -- optional, pin the plugin at specific version for stability
  dependencies = {
    {"nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim"},
    {"stevearc/dressing.nvim"} -- optional: to have the same UI shown in the GIF
  }
}
```

<summary>Detailed config</summary>
  
Right now we have only one config options

```lua
return { "LintaoAmons/bookmarks.nvim",
  config = function ()
    require("bookmarks").setup( {
      json_db_path = vim.fs.normalize(vim.fn.stdpath("config") .. "/bookmarks.db.json"),
      signs = {
        mark = { icon = "ï‚—", color = "grey" },
      },
      hooks = {
        {
          ---a sample hook that change the working directory when goto bookmark
          ---@param bookmark Bookmarks.Bookmark
          ---@param projects Bookmarks.Project[]
          callback = function(bookmark, projects)
            local project_path
            for _, p in ipairs(projects) do
              if p.name == bookmark.location.project_name then
                project_path = p.path
              end
            end
            if project_path then
              vim.cmd("cd " .. project_path)
            end
          end,
        },
      },
    })
  end
}
```

## Commands and Keybindings

There's two concepts in this plugin: `BookmarkList` and `Bookmark`.

You can look into the code to find the structure of those two domain objects

This plugin don't provide any default keybinding. I recommend you to have those three keybindings.

```lua
vim.keymap.set({ "n", "v" }, "mm", "<cmd>BookmarksMark<cr>", { desc = "Mark current line into active BookmarkList." })
vim.keymap.set({ "n", "v" }, "mo", "<cmd>BookmarksGoto<cr>", { desc = "Go to bookmark at current active BookmarkList" })
vim.keymap.set({ "n", "v" }, "ma", "<cmd>BookmarksCommands<cr>", { desc = "Find and trigger a bookmark command." })
vim.keymap.set({ "n", "v" }, "mg", "<cmd>BookmarksGotoRecent<cr>", { desc = "Go to latest visited/created Bookmark" })
```

## TODO

### V1

- [x] BookmarksMark's input box as a command line. Text start with `!` considered as command.
  - [x] `!newlist [listname]` bookmark current line into a newly created bookmark list and set the list as current active list.
- [x] remove parse commands, prefer BookmarkCommands instead
- [x] `BookmarkCommands` commands picker, a picker allow user to trigger any bookmark command.
- [x] more useful information when deal with corrupted json db (no issues report yet)
- [ ] refactor: extract picker module
- [x] telescope enhancement (use specific command instead)
- [x] A new command to create bookmark and put it into specific bookmark list (instead current active one)
- [x] Project
    - [x] Add a project field
    - [x] relative path. (project_path/relative_path can make the bookmarks portable, share your bookmarks to another people or your second laptop)
    - [ ] bookmarks of current project
    - [ ] Hooks: Gotobookmark can trigger function like switch project automatically
- [ ] Grep content in bookmarks' files

### V2

- [ ] Sequance diagram out of bookmarks: Pattern `[actor] -->actor sequance_number :: desc`
- [ ] filetree-like BookmarkList and Bookmark browsing.
    - use `nui` or a `custom buffer`
    - custom buffer (can render more things, and can nav/copy/paste with ease)
        - local Keybindings
        - popup window
        - readonly and read current line to trigger action
- [ ] Recent files as bookmarks: record all the buffer the user recently opened and sort by the visited_at
- [ ] goto next/prev bookmark in the current buffer
- [ ] smart location calibration according to bookmark content
